            <h3>Welcome to The White Lotus – A Sanctuary for Mindful Escapes</h3>
            <p>Founded by Santiago Lacayo, The White Lotus is more than just a resort—it’s an experience designed to help you disconnect, recharge, and embrace the present moment. Nestled in a tranquil paradise, our retreat encourages guests to leave behind the distractions of daily life and immerse themselves in the beauty of nature, meaningful connections, and ultimate relaxation.</p>
            <p>At The White Lotus, we believe in living in the moment. We invite you to embrace a slower pace, engage in deep conversations, and rediscover the art of being present. Whether you’re lounging by the ocean, indulging in our spa treatments, or sharing stories with fellow travelers, every detail of your stay is crafted to help you reconnect with yourself and the world around you.</p>
            <p>We encourage our guests to be open-minded, meet new people, and step away from their screens. Here, the most valuable connection isn’t WiFi—it’s the one you make with yourself and those around you.</p>
